## JDK - Java Development Kit

It is a s/w development environment used for developing java applications. It includes JRE, Loader/Interpreter(java),
Compiler(javac), archiver(jar) & other tools needed for development.

It is platform specific s/w that's why we have separate installers for Windows, MAC etc.

So JDK contains Development Tools & JRE to execute your program.
