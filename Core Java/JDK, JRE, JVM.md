## JDK - Java Development Kit

It is a s/w development environment used for developing java applications. It includes JRE, Loader/Interpreter(java),
Compiler(javac), archiver(jar) & other tools needed for development.

It is platform specific s/w that's why we have separate installers for Windows, MAC etc.

So JDK contains Development Tools & JRE to execute your program.

## JVM - Java Virtual Machine

Its a spcification where working of JVM is specified. And there are different implementations provided by Sun & other
companies.

Whenever you run java program, an instance of JVM is created & JVM is responsible for running your program sequentially.

It is contained both in JDk & JRE.

## JRE - Java Runtime Environment

It is an implementation of JVM & provides platform to execute programs. 

JRE doesn't contain any development tools. If you just want to execute a program JRE is suffiecient.

It contains JVM & libraries.


**NOTE - JDK, JRE & JVM are all platform dependent, however Java is platform independent.**
